# Boba Buddy

## Overview
**Boba Buddy** is a website that allows for a user to view a comprehensive list of boba and milk tea shops in the Denver Metro Area as filtered by region. Although there is now an abudance of boba and milk tea shops, it can still be hard to find relevant results and/or information when searching on the internet. Shops included in this app are those with their own storefront and those that feature boba and/or milk tea as a significant part of their menus. Compiled in an easy to navigate format, users can obtain a shop's name and address and be directed to the shop's various social media links or websites. Users can also search for a shop by name.

#### Goals
- Demonstrate competence with React, Router, asynchornous JavaScript, and end-to-end testing with Cypress
- Implement self-learning goals such as building an [API in Express](https://github.com/kpn678/boba-buddy-api) and implementing React Hooks and Async/await
- Work within constraints to deliver a product that solves a unique problem for a specific audience

#### Project Specs
The rubric and specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).
